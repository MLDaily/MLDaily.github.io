Machine learning has been the secret sauce of the much hyped technical advancements, but what is Machine learning?<br><br>

Machine learning is a subfield of computer science, that evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory of artificial intelligence. Machine learning aims to study, and develop algorithms that can learn from, and make predictions on a variety of data. It is the science of making the computers act without being explicitly programmed to do so!<br><br>

Lets drill down. Have you wondered at how google play know the apps you might want to download? Or, how Flipkart offers you a discount a product you are interested in buying ? Or, if I may, have you tried playing chess with a computer and ended up losing every time ? All these incidents are no coincidene, no magic. Wondering what it is then?

The answer is, Artificial Intelligence!<br><br>

Now, you might have heard of it, but you might not know a great deal about it, or, wish to learn about AI from scratch, or might as well be an expert at it. Even if you are slightly interested in this field, you will find this guide cum blog handy. Packed with all excitment and knowlegede we have regaridng AI and ML, we are here to learn, teach and share.<br><br>

One topic at a time, we start with the basics, and finish with the most advanced ones (although in this age of evolution, it might never end). Care enough for the journey ? Stay tuned for more.<br><br>



<!-- This blog was developed in order for us, in the organization, to get a complete understanding of how projects in machine learning are done and what we, as students, could do to use this knowledge to contribute to <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.<br> -->

<!-- Every Machine Learning Process requires a few steps to be taken first in order to improve the performance of the output of the algorithm applied. Usually these steps involve framing the data so the only specific required features are used for processing the information and other not so useful features are left out.<br>

But before this pre-processing step, another step has to be taken in order for us to be able to mine the data efficiently. For instance, we might run a simple algorithm on a limited set of data, but in the real world the simulations are done based on all of the available data so as to gain most accuracy. So, first we take a look at the <strong><a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Cluster Architecture</a></strong> which help us efficiently access the data that could be of the size of hundreds of TerraBytes !
