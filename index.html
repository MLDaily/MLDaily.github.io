				<h2>Welcome to <strong>Machine Learning Daily</strong> !</h2><br><hr><br>
				<p class="lead">This blog was developed in order for us, in the organization, to get a complete understanding of how projects in machine learning are done and what we, as students, could do to use this knowledge to contribute to <mark>Machine Learning</mark>.</p><br><hr><br>
				<p class="lead">Types of <mark>Chart Plots</mark> that are usually used in displaying what kind of data we have : <br>
					<ul class="list-group">
						<a href="boxplot.html" class="list-group-item"><strong>Box Plots</strong></a>
						<a href="quantile.html" class="list-group-item"><strong>Quantile-Quantile Plots</strong></a>
						<a href="histogram.html" class="list-group-item"><strong>Histograms</strong></a>
						<a href="scatter.html" class="list-group-item"><strong>Scatter Plots</strong></a>
					</ul>

					The first process that should be taken care of during the Data Mining process is the <mark>Preprocessing of Data</mark>. The Data can be available to us in any format, it may be big, so that we are not able to process all the data at once, or it may have useless attributes which are not required to be processed and will only take disc space while running an algorithm on them. We may even be acquiring data from different sources and hence might need to organise them such that they are compatible with each other. It is possible that the data has some missing values, noisy data etc. which need to be taken care of first.
					<br>
					In order to convert that data according to the needs of the algorithms being applied on them, we need to apply preprocessing. Data Preprocessing includes cleaning, normalisation, transformation, feature extraction, selection, reduction etc. The product of data preprocessing is the final training set.
