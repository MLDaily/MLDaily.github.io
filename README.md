# MLDaily

We have been working our way around machine learning for quite some time. After exploring, and learning so much, we felt there was a need to pen down what we know, for record keeping. This in turn will give us a better understanding of the projects we undertake, and what we, as students, can do to contribute to <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.<br><br>

The blog covers the most widley used algorithms in implementation. Given the vastness of domain, we shall restrict ourselves to  algorithms used in either Machine Learning or Data Mining. Each algorithm is packed with its implementation in Python or R. To make the content more human friendly, real life examples and case studies are shared, where ever apt. Our method aims to maximize the understand and appreciation, while minimising the obscurity surrounding this amazing area of study. <br><br>

We personally thank you for taking out time and viewing our blog. Hoping it proved helpful. If not, please do mail us (or tweet us) your suggestions, and we shall try accomodating them in the upcoming posts.<br><br>

You can take a look at the blog [here](https://mldaily.github.io).
