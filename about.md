This blog was developed in order for us, in the organization, to get a complete understanding of how projects in machine learning are done and what we, as students, could do to use this knowledge to contribute to <strong>Machine Learning</strong>.<br><br>

What we are trying to do is to give basic implementation knowledge of some frequently applied algorithms. We will keep this blog related to the algorithms used in Machine Learning or Data Mining and with each of the algorithms discussed in the blog, we will try to explain one area of application where the algorithm has been applied and how the algorithm in the area has been able to benefit mankind.<br><br>

Every week, this blog will have one more algorithm with its implementation, and the application the algorithm has been most used in. We personally thank you for taking out time and viewing our blog and hope that it was helpful in some way or the other. If not, please do mail us (or tweet us) your suggestions and we will try to take them up in the upcoming posts.<br><br>
